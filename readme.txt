First of all, i have downloaded the Destinationspage.png.
Understood the page layout, as how should it be, then i created an ejs file that had the layout.
Then I have created a javascript file that had an object.
Object consists of the place images links, name of the places.
And now I have delivered the photos of the places, names of the places using the js file.
Displayed in the ejs file.

Extract the zip file
Run npm i in the terminal
Run the command nodemon app
Open localhost:4000 on the browser to see the functioning.
